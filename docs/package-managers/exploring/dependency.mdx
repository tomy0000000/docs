# Dependency

```mdx-code-block
import { Icon } from '@iconify/react';
import PacageManagerCommands from '@site/src/components/PacageManagerCommands';
import commands from '@site/src/data/package-manager-commands.json';
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```

List all dependencies of an installable.

In another word, find out a package depend on which other packages.

<PacageManagerCommands commands={commands.dependency} />

:::warning

For `npm`, you need to install the package first before you can list its dependencies.
In addition, [this command is expected change in the future](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-ls#note-design-changes-pending).
