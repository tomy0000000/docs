# Coding Fonts

Fonts that are good for coding, typically have:

- Good readability
- Distinguishable characters
- Consistent width (monospace)

[Powerline Fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) patched fonts are a good choice for coding. They are patched with special characters that are used by powerline and other status line plugins, which are good for terminal and text editor status lines.

or go extra nerdy with [Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts), which are patched with even more special characters.
