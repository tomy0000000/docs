# Meslo LG

Andr√© Berg adjusted the line gap of the Apple's Menlo font to make it more readable in the terminal.

- `LG` stands for Line Gap
- Followed by the size of line gap: `S`, `M`, `L`.
- Optionally followed by `DZ` for dot zero, which means the center of zero character is a dot, or slash zero, which means the center of zero character is a slash when `DZ` is not specified.
