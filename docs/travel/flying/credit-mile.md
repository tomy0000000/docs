# Credit Miles

How to decide which frequent flyer credit program to credit your flights to.

1. List the programs that can be credited to the flight.
   - Check the airline's website for the list of programs that can be credited to the flight.
   - Normally, for airlines that are part of an alliance, all the airlines in the alliance can be credited to the flight.
   - Additionally, some airlines have partnerships with other airlines that allow you to credit to the other airline's program.
2. Calculate the miles you will earn for each program.
   - Air miles-based program
     - Find out the actual distance miles you will be flying ($D$)
       - Can be found on [Air Miles Calculator](https://www.airmilescalculator.com)
     - Find out the Redeemable Miles Earning Rates ($RDM$)
       - Usually denoted as a percentage of the actual miles flown
       - Percentage can vary depending on the cabin class
       - Can be found on [Where to Credit](https://www.wheretocredit.com)
       - or the frequent flyer program's website, Search for `(Name of airline, program) Mileage Table`
     - The miles you will earn $M = D \times RDM$
   - Fare-based program
     - Find out the Fare of the ticket ($P$)
     - Find out the Redeemable Miles Earning Rates ($RDM$)
       - Usually denoted as `n miles per dollar spent`
       - Different status levels may have different rates
       - Can be found on [Where to Credit](https://www.wheretocredit.com)
       - or the frequent flyer program's website, Search for `(Name of airline, program) Mileage Table`
     - The miles you will earn $M = P \times RDM$
3. Evaluate the mile value ($VPM$)
   - Denoted as `cents per mile`
   - This can be subjective and depends on your travel habits and goals.
   - e.g. If you are pursuing a status in a program, they may have a higher value for you.

4. Calculate the value of the miles you will earn for each program
   - The estimated value of the miles you will earn $V = M \times VPM$
5. The highest value program is the one you should credit to.
6. Be careful of other factors
   - Some speciality tickets may have additional rules
   - Status benefits (e.g. If you are pursuing a status of a program, consider raising their $VPM$)
   - Expiration of miles (e.g. Some program expire miles, some don't)
