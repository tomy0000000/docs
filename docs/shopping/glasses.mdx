# ðŸ‘“ Glasses

Guide to shop a pair of glasses.

## Prescription

For prescription glasses, these are the must have numbers:

|                | Sphere (SPH) | Cylinder (CYL) | Axis | PD  |
| -------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ---- | --- |
| OD (Right eye) |              |                |      |     |
| OS (Left eye)  |              |                |      |     |

_Note: Most PD only have only one number_

## Lens

- Bifocal / Progressive: Lens for both nearsightedness, and farsightedness
- Polarized: Reduces glare from reflective surfaces like water, snow, and glass
- Anti-Reflective: Coating that minimizes glare and reflections to improve visual acuity
- Light-Reactive / Photochromic: Change color under strong sunlight
- Hig-index: Thinner lens for higher prescription

| Prescription       | Recommend       |
| ------------------ | --------------- |
| +/-4.00 ~ +/-8.00  | 1.67 high-index |
| +/-8.00 and higher | 1.74 high-index |

## Frame

Located at the arm of the glass, denoted as:

```
{Lens Width}âƒž{Bridge Width}-{Arm Length}
```

<div class="flex">
  <Image filename="glasses-lens-width.avif" alt="Lens Width">

  </Image>
  <Image filename="glasses-bridge-width.avif" alt="Bridge Width">
    Bridge Width

  <Image filename="glasses-arm-length.avif" alt="Arm Length">
    Arm Length
  </Image>
  <Image filename="glasses-lens-height.avif" alt="Lens Height">

  </Image>
</div>

### Tips

- Frame width should be slightly larger than face.
- If your PD number is low, your bridge width should also be shorter.
- Round face goes with square frame, vice versa, but not a must.
- Frame color best matched with face and hair with the same color.
