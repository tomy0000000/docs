# ðŸ’¾ Disk

How to choose the right disk for your PC, Server, or NAS.

## HDD

<abbr title="Hard Disk Drive">HDD</abbr> is a storage device that uses magnetic storage to store and retrieve digital information using one or more rigid rapidly rotating disks coated with magnetic material.

## SSD

<abbr title="Solid State Drive">SSD</abbr> is a storage device that uses integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data persistently.

1. Install `smartmontools`

```bash
brew install smartmontools
```

2. Check status

```bash
sudo smartctl --all /dev/disk0 # Replace disk0 with the disk you want to check
```

3. Look for the "Media Wearout Indicator" value. New SSDs have a value of 100, and the value decreases as the drive wears out.
