Cheap way to shop for Apple products.

## Buying abroad

Use [The Mac Index](https://themacindex.com/) to check the price of Apple products in different countries.

Be mindful about details:

- **Keyboard layout**: Make sure you choose the right one :)
- **Power plug**: Will it be compatible with your country? If not, most Apple power plug can work with the [World Travel Adapter Kit](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MD837AM/A/apple-world-travel-adapter-kit), or just use your existing power plug.
- **Warranty**: Will it be valid in your country?
- **Sales tax**: Some countries include sales tax in the price, some don't. Some country has a refund system for tourists, some don't.
- **Import tax**: Does your country have import tax?
- **Shipping**: Is there a shipping fee? How long will it take before you receive the product? (in store, or at your hotel)
