# YAML

The language that was named "_Yet Another Markup Language_" and later renamed to "_YAML Ain't Markup Language_" is a human-friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages. It is commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted.

Spec: <GitHubBadge slug="yaml/yaml-spec" />

## Key Takeaways

- Use YAML for configuration files and data serialization.
- YAML is designed to be relaxed and flaky for human readability, so be careful with indentation and quoting.
- Anchors and Aliases can be powerful and useful. Though they are part of the spec, check with the tools you are using to see if they support it, as some tools don't support it or have their own implementation of it.
