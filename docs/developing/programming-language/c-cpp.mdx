## C++ Mutex

### Mutex Type

- **Timed**: The mutex can be locked with a timeout.
- **Recursive**: The mutex can be locked multiple times by the same thread, for example, in a recursive function.
- **Shared**: The mutex can be locked in shared mode by multiple threads, for example, for reading.

| Mutex                        | Timed | Recursive | Shared |
| ---------------------------- | ----- | --------- | ------ |
| `std::mutex`                 | ❌    | ❌        | ❌     |
| `std::timed_mutex`           | ✅    | ❌        | ❌     |
| `std::recursive_mutex`       | ❌    | ✅        | ❌     |
| `std::recursive_timed_mutex` | ✅    | ✅        | ❌     |
| `std::shared_mutex`          | ❌    | ❌        | ✅     |
| `std::shared_timed_mutex`    | ✅    | ❌        | ✅     |

### Locking Functions

- `lock_guard`: No-brainer, simple, single mutex locking.
- `scoped_lock`: Locks multiple mutex at once.
- `unique_lock`: Can unlock and relock the mutex when needed.
- `shared_lock`: Shared (read) access with a shared mutex.
