Guides for developing in different languages.

## Version Managers

Some tools that can help manage multiple versions of programming languages on the same host.

### Generic

- <GitHubBadge slug="asdf-vm/asdf" />: Installable are provided via plugin, so
  virtually all CLIs can be version managed.

### Python

- <GitHubBadge slug="pyenv/pyenv" />: Inspired by `rbenv`

### Ruby

- <GitHubBadge slug="rbenv/rbenv" />

### Go

- <GitHubBadge slug="go-nv/goenv" />: Inspired by `rbenv`

### Node.js

- <GitHubBadge slug="volta-cli/volta" />: The modern go-to option
- <GitHubBadge slug="tj/n" />: The community-beloved OG, but manage version by
  copy/paste, which can be troublesome when messed with `sudo`.
- <GitHubBadge slug="nodenv/nodenv" />: Inspired by `rbenv`, but not much
  popular.
- <GitHubBadge slug="pnpm/pnpm" />: Also does version management, but won't
  installed `corepack` like native node.js does so working with yarn can be a
  issue.

### Perl

- <GitHubBadge slug="gugod/App-perlbrew" />
