# JavaScript Library

Quick reference for all kinds of tasks.

## Datetime

JavaScript have native `Date` object, as well as experimental `Temporal` object.

Checkout the [cookbook](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/cookbook.html) and [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal). You can polyfill them today with:

- <GitHubBadge slug="js-temporal/temporal-polyfill" />
- <GitHubBadge slug="fullcalendar/temporal-polyfill" />

Other more humanize features are provided in third-party library:

- <GitHubBadge slug="iamkun/dayjs" />: Super tiny Moment.js drop-in replacement,
  the modern go-to option.
- <GitHubBadge slug="moment/moment" />: The OG. Full features, widely-used, but
  in maintainence mode.
- <GitHubBadge slug="moment/luxon" />: The modern reboot of Moment.js.
- <GitHubBadge slug="date-fns/date-fns" />: Native-focus, good for proejct that
  do not used much humanize feature and looking to adopt Temporal in the future.
