## [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)

- Install and managed multiple versions of Python on the same machine.
- Control python version in _global_, _local_, and _shell_ levels.
- 👍🏻 Written in shell script, does not require pre-existed Python installation.
- 👎🏻 Use shims to inject the correct Python version into your shell.
- Does not support Windows natively, but there's [pyenv-win/pyenv-win](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win).

## Homebrew

Homebrew can install [multiple versions](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/) of Python, e.g.

```shell
brew install python@3.12
```

:::warning

Homebrew pythons exists to serve other formulas. Always use virtual environment and do not install other packages into Homebrew Python.
