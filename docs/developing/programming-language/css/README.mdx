How to style your website.

## Selectors

These two guides should cover most of what you need to know:

- [W3Schools CSS Selectors Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.php)
- [CSS-Tricks - CSS Selectors](https://css-tricks.com/css-selectors/)

## Normalize

CSS comes with some default styles that are not consistent across browsers. You may follow [this guide](https://css-tricks.com/alvaro-montoro-css-one-liners-to-improve-almost-every-project/) to get a reasonable baseline.

Or just use one of the following:

- [necolas/normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
- [sindresorhus/modern-normalize](https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize)

:::info

If you're using a CSS framework, it may already include a normalize file.

## Layout

- Use **Flexbox** for 1D layout
- Use [**Grid**](./css-grid.md) for 2D layout
