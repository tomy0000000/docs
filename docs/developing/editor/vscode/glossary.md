# Glossary

- The `Default` profile has all extensions installed and ready for any project.
- Language profiles are used to install extensions to support a specific language. Currently, the following language profiles are available:
  - `C/C++`
  - `Python`
  - `Go`
  - `Java`
  - `JavaScript/TypeScript`
  - `Ruby`
  - `Scala`
- The rationale for language profiles is to reduce the system resources required to run VSCode by only installing the extensions required for a project.
- Settings, Keyboard Shortcuts, User snippets, User Tasks are profile-agnostic to provide a consistent experience across all profiles.
