# Linking

Best practices for linking in HTML.

## Internal/External Links

- Internal links should open in the same tab.
- External links should open in a new tab.

To open link in a new tab, follow this example:

```html
<a href="https://" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>
```

The `noopener` and `noreferrer` are used to prevent the newly opened tab from accessing the `window.opener` property.
