# Asymmetric Encryption

Asymmetric encryption is a type of encryption where a pair of keys is used to encrypt and decrypt electronic information. The key pair consists of a public key and a private key. The public key is used to encrypt the information and the private key is used to decrypt it.

## Order of preference

1. <a href="./glossary#libraries">Well-Known Libraries</a>
2. <abbr title="Elliptic Curve Cryptography">`ECC`</abbr>
3. `RSA-KEM`: RSA Key Encapsulation Mechanism
4. `RSA-OAEP`: RSA Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding

:::danger

The latter part of this document will cover the RSA encryption process, but getting RSA right is hard and **SHOULD BE AVOIDED**, even with the right libraries. Prefer the first two options whenever possible.

:::

## RSA Key Generation

- Storage Format
  - Recommended: Encode in base64 with <abbr title="Privacy Enhanced Mail">`PEM`</abbr> format.
  - Alternatively, store in binary with <abbr title="Distinguished Encoding Rules">`DER`</abbr> format.
- Bit length
  - Recommended: `2048` bits. Good balance between security and performance.
  - Alternatively, consider `3072` or `4096` for higher security. Note that this will slow down encryption/decryption.

### Private key

<Tabs groupId="rsa-gen-key">
  <TabItem value="modern" label="PKCS#8">

    Recommended. More modern and flexible.

    ```shell
    openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private_key.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
    ```

    The output key header will be `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----`.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="legacy" label="PKCS#1">

    Specific to RSA (Legacy)

    ```shell
    openssl genrsa -out private_key.pem 2048
    ```

    The output key header may be `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` or `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Public key

:::info

Public key are derived from private key.

:::

<Tabs groupId="rsa-gen-key">
  <TabItem value="modern" label="PKIX">

    Recommended. PKIX (Public Key Infrastructure) also known as X.509 or SPKI (Subject Public Key Info)

    ```shell
    openssl rsa -pubout -in private_key.pem -out public_key.pem
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="legacy" label="PKCS#1">

    Legacy format specific to RSA

    ```shell
    openssl rsa -in private_key.pem -RSAPublicKey_out -out public_key.pem
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## `RSA-KEM`

High level overview:

1. Create a random symmetric key
2. Encrypt it with RSA public key
3. Encrypt the data with the symmetric key
4. Send the encrypted symmetric key and the encrypted data

## `RSA-OAEP`

### Hashing

- `SHA-256`: Recommended
- `SHA-1`: Cryptographically broken, and should not be used.

### Padding

- <abbr title="Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding">`OAEP`</abbr>: Recommended
- PKCS#1 v1.5: Legacy

### Label

By default the label is empty, but it can be set to a specific value. Both the encryptor and decryptor must use the same label.

## ☠️ AVOID THESE

- `RSA` in general
- `ElGamal`
- `OpenPGP`, `OpenSSL`, `BouncyCastle`, etc.
