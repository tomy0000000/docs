## For Backend

### <Icon icon="simple-icons:render" inline={true} /> [Render](https://render.com/)

- ✅ Go-to replacement for Heroku for general purpose backend app
- ✅ Global CDN built-in
- ⚠️ Scaling, globalize is not as great as Fly.io and Vercel

### <Icon icon="simple-icons:railway" inline={true} /> [Railway](https://railway.app)

- Backed by Google Cloud, [but going on-prem](https://blog.railway.com/p/data-center-build-part-one)
- ✅ Very transparent pricing
- ✅ Great DX
- ⚠️ No Free-tier
- ⚠️ Harder to customize
- ⚠️ Does not scale well

### <Icon icon="logos:fly-icon" inline={true} /> [Fly.io](https://fly.io/)

- ✅ Great global distribution
- ✅ Best-in-class Docker deployment
- ✅ Low-latency
- ⚠️ Steep learning curve, DX is not on-par

### <Icon icon="skill-icons:heroku" inline={true} /> [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

- Backed by AWS
- ✅ The OG, super easy to start for small project
- ⚠️ Free-tier is gone
- ⚠️ Cold start is quite long
- ⚠️ Quite expensive to scale

### Misc
