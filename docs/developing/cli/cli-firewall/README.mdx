# üõ°Ô∏è Firewall CLIs

## Core Tools

- `ipfwadm`: Originated with Linux 1.2.x/2.0.x. Inspired by BSD‚Äôs `ipfw`.
  - Simple stateless packet filtering
- `ipchains`: Introduced with Linux 2.2.x
  - Basic stateful packet filtering
  - Better chain organization
  - NAT support
  - IPv6 support: `ip6chains`.
- `iptables` / Netfilter: Introduced with Linux 2.4.x
  - Netfilter became a kernel-space framework for hooks and connection tracking.
  - `iptables` is the user-space command-line tool to configure Netfilter.
  - Module-based architecture for extensibility.
  - IPv6 support: `ip6tables`.
- `nftables`: Introduced with Linux 3.13.x
  - Replaces `iptables`, `ip6tables`, `arptables`, and `ebtables`.
  - Uses a single command-line tool: `nft`.
  - More efficient rule processing with a new virtual machine.
  - De-duplicates v4/v6 rules

## Distro Frontends

- `firewalld` (Red Hat, Fedora, CentOS)
  - Uses `iptables`/`nftables` as backend.
  - Dynamic firewall management with zones and services.
  - D-Bus interface for programmatic control.
- `ufw` (Ubuntu)
  - Simplified interface for `iptables`.
  - Friendly wrapper that auto-generates rules underneath.
