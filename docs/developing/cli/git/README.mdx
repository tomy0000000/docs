## Signing

You can sign commits, tags, objects, and even push to certify your identity.

There are three ways to sign, specified by the `gpg.format` configuration variable:

- `openpgp`: Use OpenPGP keys, the default.
- `ssh`: Use SSH keys, the easiest.
- `x509`: Use X.509 certificates, mostly used in enterprise.

If you're using x.509, just follow your organization's instructions. For the rest of us, just use SSH.

Regardless of `openpgp` or `ssh`, always follow the "One key per device" principle.
