## Notation

| Symbol   | Name               | Used for                                                |
| -------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| $O$      | Big O notation     | Upper Bound, Worst-case                                 |
| $\Omega$ | Big Omega notation | Lower Bound, Best-case                                  |
| $\Theta$ | Big Theta notation | Tight Bound, represents both an upper and a lower bound |

:::tip

Big O notation is versatile and widely used to describe the upper bound on the time or space complexity of an algorithm, which can apply to the worst-case, average-case, or even best-case scenarios, depending on the context in which it's used.

In this section, we use big O notation to describe the worst-case time complexity of an algorithm unless otherwise specified.

:::warning

Big theta notation does not represent the average-case, it represents both an upper and a lower bound. To represent the average case, use big O notation with text explaining the average case.
